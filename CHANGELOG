1.0.0
-----

2016-03-28

This is a major feature release with small breaks in backwards compatibility.

  * (GH-48) Add support for the create, group and owner synced_folder options.

  * (GH-50) Add support for vagrant-openstack-provider and
    vagrant-openstack-plugin.

  * (GH-51) Add support for the vagrant-softlayer provider.

  * (GH-52) Support for new Vagrant 1.8.1 features and a sweeping refresh of
    just about every data model to ensure most Vagrant configuration options are
    supported.

  * (GH-53) Models now require much, much less boilerplate. In most cases, a
    a class that inherits form Model::Base and uses def_model_attribute will
    Do The Right Thingâ„¢ without requiring further code.

  * (GH-46) All provider models inheriting from Model::Provider::Base now
    support provider-specific overrides. All core provider models have been
    refactored to use this base class.

  * ModelDelegator functionality has been moved to Model::Base to support
    (GH-46). The ModelDelegator module still exists but is deprecated and does
    nothing.

  * (GH-40) All provisioner models inheriting from Model::Provisioner::Base now
    support provisioner-specific options such as name and run. All core
    provisioner models have been refactored to use this base class.

  * BREAK: The name attribute of the shell provisioner has been re-purposed to
    support named provisioners in (GH-40).

  * There is now an integration suite that tests whether config_builder
    correctly transforms data into Vagrant objects.

Many thanks to Brett Delle Grazie and Christoph Fiehe for their contributions
to this release.

  * (GH-43) Add basic support for the vagrant-aws provider.

  * (GH-42) The Puppet provisioner now supports Hiera configuration options.

  * (GH-47) The single `provisioner` setting for VMs is now deprecated and will
